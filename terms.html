    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> September 08, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to Context Nexus (“we”, “our”, “us”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of
       our website at <a href="https://www.contextnexus.dev/">contextnexus.dev</a> (the “Site”) and our software plugin(s) and related
       services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>Context Nexus provides developer tools and a discussion channel. We sell subscriptions and licenses to our plugin(s)
       via third-party payment processor and merchant-of-record Lemon Squeezy. We also provide a newsletter via Buttondown.
       See our Privacy Policy for details.</p>

    <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you
       represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3) Accounts</h2>
    <p>Some features may require an account with third-party platforms (e.g., Lemon Squeezy for checkout, GitHub/Discord for discussion).
       You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your account(s).</p>

    <h2>4) Purchases, subscriptions, and trials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Merchant-of-Record:</strong> Payments are processed by Lemon Squeezy, which acts as the Merchant of Record.
          Your purchase is subject to Lemon Squeezy’s terms, tax handling, and invoicing.</li>
      <li><strong>Plans and pricing:</strong> Pricing and features will be shown on the Site and/or the Lemon Squeezy checkout page. We may update
          pricing in the future; changes will apply on renewal or as otherwise stated at checkout.</li>
      <li><strong>Free trials:</strong> We may offer free trials via our Site or via third‑party marketplaces (e.g., a plugin marketplace).
          Trial duration and limits will be displayed at the point of signup.</li>
      <li><strong>Renewals and cancellations:</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled. You can manage or cancel
          your subscription using the link provided in your order email or your Lemon Squeezy customer portal.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund eligibility may be governed by Lemon Squeezy’s refund policies and any policy we publish on the Site.
          Where permitted, refund requests should be initiated through your order receipt or by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Licensing and activation (plugins)</h2>
    <p>Paid features of our plugin(s) may require license activation and periodic validation. You agree not to bypass,
       modify, or interfere with activation, license checks, usage limits, or related security mechanisms. We may suspend
       or limit access to paid features if a license is expired, cancelled, refunded, or otherwise invalid.</p>

    <h2>6) Acceptable use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No unlawful, harmful, or infringing use of the Services.</li>
      <li>No reverse engineering, decompiling, or circumventing of technical protections, except where permitted by law.</li>
      <li>No unauthorized scraping, load testing, or interference with Site operations.</li>
      <li>Respect community spaces (e.g., our discussion channel); do not post spam, hate speech, or abusive content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The Services, including all text, graphics, logos, and software, are owned by us or our licensors and are protected
       by intellectual‑property laws. Subject to these Terms and your payment of applicable fees, we grant you a limited,
       non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the plugin(s) for your personal or internal business purposes.</p>

    <h2>8) Third‑party services</h2>
    <p>We rely on third‑party services for certain features:
      Lemon Squeezy (payments, licensing), Buttondown (email newsletter), and optional discussion platforms (e.g., GitHub
      Discussions via Giscus, Discord). Your use of those services may be subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>9) Warranty disclaimer</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of
       any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
       particular purpose, and non‑infringement.</p>

    <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
       or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of
       data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your use of or inability to use the Services;
       (b) any conduct or content of third parties; (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</p>

    <h2>11) Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Context Nexus and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from and
       against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising out of or in any way connected with your use
       of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12) Changes to the Services and Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify or discontinue parts of the Services at any time. We may also update these Terms from time to time.
       If we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms on the Site with a new effective date. Your continued
       use of the Services after the changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>13) Governing law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in your country of residence unless otherwise required by mandatory law.
       Any disputes will be subject to the competent courts of that jurisdiction.</p>
