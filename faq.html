                        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Our "Custom Endpoint" feature is designed for this purpose. It allows you to connect to any API that is compatible with the OpenAI format, which is ideal for using open-source models running locally (e.g., with Ollama or LM Studio) or connecting to private, self-hosted inference servers.</p></div>
