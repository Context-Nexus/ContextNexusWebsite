# Context Nexus
The official landing page and issue tracker for the Context Nexus AI tool.

### Your Project's Expert Co-Pilot, Inside Unreal Engine.

Context Nexus transforms your AI assistant into a development partner that **truly understands your project.** It eliminates the endless cycle of repeating context, debugging inaccurate AI responses, and wasting tokens.

It works by building a lightweight, intelligent library of your project's Blueprints, C++, and assets, giving you:

*   **Flawless AI-Powered Explanations:** Get instant, accurate descriptions of any node, function, or class, because the AI finally has the full picture.
*   **Context-Aware Code Generation:** Ask the AI to refactor logic, add variables, and scaffold new systems with confidence, knowing its suggestions are based on your actual code.
*   **Dramatically Reduced Onboarding Time:** Give new team members an AI co-pilot that can explain any part of the project, saving weeks of re-explaining and documentation hunting.

From solo indies to AAA studios, Context Nexus saves time, reduces friction, and keeps your project crystal clear.

**Stop wrestling with context. Start building with clarity.**

## Key Features

### Deep Project Understanding
The engine goes beyond simple parsing to develop a genuine understanding of your architecture.

*   **Understands Event-Driven Logic:** Intelligently traverses event stubs like `Event Tick` or `Begin Play` to analyze the *actual* execution chain, providing the AI with a perfect understanding of your gameplay flow.
*   **Resolves Complex Dependencies:** Automatically finds and includes every function and variable a piece of code depends on, creating a complete, self-contained, and perfectly lean context for the AI.
*   **Optimized for AI:** Generates a clean, token-efficient Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is enriched with default values and pin connections, designed for maximum AI accuracy.

### A Truly Native Workflow
Built from the ground up to feel like an indispensable, native part of the Unreal Editor.

*   **Fully Integrated UI:** The entire workflowâ€”project scanning, context building, and AI chatâ€”happens within a single, polished editor window. No more copying and pasting between external tools.
*   **Instant Asset Discovery:** A searchable "Project Explorer" lets you find and select any asset, function, or variable in seconds.
*   **Content Browser Integration:** Right-click any Blueprint in the Content Browser and add it directly to your context.

### Professional & Production-Ready
Engineered with the security, stability, and features required for professional development.

*   **Full AI Model Control:** Configure the `Model Name`, `Temperature`, `Top P`, `Max Output Tokens`, and custom `Stop Sequences` to fine-tune your AI's behavior.
*   **Secure Licensing Framework:** Features a robust, 7-day trial system with seamless offline activation for the full version.
*   **Live Token Counter:** Maintain complete control over your costs by seeing the exact size of your context payload before you send it.

## ðŸš€ The Roadmap Ahead

Our vision is to create a truly collaborative development partner. Our next major goals include:

*   **Live Static Analysis:** A proactive "linter" that provides real-time feedback and warnings about potential issues in your Blueprints as you work.
*   **AI-Powered Actions:** The ability for the AI to suggest and, with your one-click approval, safely apply simple changesâ€”like creating variables or refactoring functionsâ€”directly to your assets.
